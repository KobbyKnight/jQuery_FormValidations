# jQuery_FormValidations
This is a repository for common jQuery Validations for Forms I use.

### Feel free to make use of it.

Will make adjustments when I can. Includes links for _<b>IntelInput</b>_ utils,
You need to include that in your project. It offers validation for teleplone
number fields and overwrites the css of <b>input[type="tel"]</b> to make it a dropdown.

### Replace all links to meet appropriate environments and location of IntelInput library
The links to intelInput in the sample points to the base_url (PHP syntax)/ assets/...
Modify it to suite your needs so that it works with your project.
